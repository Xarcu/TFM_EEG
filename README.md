# TFM_EEG
Project for the Final Thesis Master in Neuroengineering and Rehabilitation at the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya. 


## Guidelines

The Python version is 3.11.6 and is loaded by conda. The Miniconda or Anaconda packages are required.

We will use VSCode with the MS-Python Extension. 

The coding style for this project will be based on the [PEP8 Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

We document functions and classes with [google Docstrings](https://gist.github.com/redlotus/3bc387c2591e3e908c9b63b97b11d24e). This is the default behavior of the autoDocString extension.

For git, we will commit with one of the following tags:

- `[NEW]` a new feature or file
- `[REF]` refactoring or moving code
- `[DOC]` documenting
- `[DEL]` removing code
- `[TMP]` temporary commit. should be avoided when possible.
